there are 365 days in the year, but only one dedicated to love: February 14. big brands invented this holiday as another occasion for us to buy gifts.

but love is not a once-a-year gift. love is the little things, it's care and affection throughout the year.

with Valentine's Year we want to show that it's important to give love all the time, not just on February 14.
