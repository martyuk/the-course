there are 365 days in the year, yet only one, February 14th, is designated for love. big brands invented this holiday as another occasion for us to buy gifts. but love is not a gift you give once a year. love is about the little things, daily acts of kindness throughout the year.

Valentine's Year highlights the importance of celebrating love every day, not just on February 14th.
