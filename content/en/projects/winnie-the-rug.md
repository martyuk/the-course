on February 28, 2023 Disney ceased all operations in Russia, restricting access to all their content. this decision not only marks the end of Disney's presence in Russia but also signifies an end to the idea of profiting off of childhood and associated memories.

### fairy tale
once upon a time, in a faraway land beyond the Hundred Acre Wood, there was a magical rug crafted from the softest fabric one could imagine. even the most cynical zoomers marveled at its cuddly and imaginative design.

it was whispered that the rug had been made from the hide of the world's most expensive bear. dubbed "Winnie-the-Rug", it embedded the power of love and friendship to make even the toughest days feel a little softer and warmer.
