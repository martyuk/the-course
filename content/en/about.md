### The Audacious School of Astonishing Pursuits
_course on creativity from Executive Creative Director at Wieden+Kennedy Portland_. the author of the most famous work for Old Spice and KFC turned me into a creative megamachine.

### Product.degree
_a program for product managers by Sports.ru and Aviasales_. here I figured out what product managers do. now I know that product and marketing are two sides of the same thing.

### Wordshop

### Moscow Engineering Physics Institute
_specialist in economic security_. this is where I learned to calculate NPV and manage projects according to ISO 9000. I read the PMBOK and developed financial models.

### Moscow Engineering Physics Institute
