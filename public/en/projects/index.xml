      <description>there are 365 days in the year, yet only one, February 14th, is designated for love. big brands invented this holiday as another occasion for us to buy gifts. but love is not a gift you give once a year. love is about the little things, daily acts of kindness throughout the year.&#xA;Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Year highlights the importance of celebrating love every day, not just on February 14th.&#xA;art by: @ramenyanen @slaves_of_love_ @choogoonkina_art @art.</description>

      <description>for many of us, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s has become a symbol of a time that began with the first restaurant on Pushkinskaya and ended with the &amp;ldquo;suspension of operations&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;we have preserved the memory of that era in the &amp;ldquo;canned Big Mac&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;ingredients: beef patties, Big Mac sauce, pickle slices, lettuce, onions, and buns not included.&#xA;nutritional value per 100 grams: emptiness, pain, and hint of sorrow.</description>

      <description>Disney long ago stopped making cartoons to tell children about the value of love and friendship. now Disney is using &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rsquo;s content&amp;rdquo; to raise new generations of future consumers of its goods and services. Winnie the Pooh went from being a friendly bear to a multi-million dollar franchise.&#xA;on February 28, 2023, Disney withdrew from Russia and took all content with it. this decision not only marks the end of Disney&amp;rsquo;s presence in Russia but also signifies an end to the idea of profiting off childhood and childhood memories.</description>
